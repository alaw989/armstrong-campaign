# Armstrong for Houston County

## What This Is

A single-page political campaign website for Xzandria Armstrong, running for office in Houston County, GA. The site focuses on driving donations while introducing the candidate, showcasing her platform, and displaying campaign photography. Simple, elegant, and modern — designed to launch quickly by March 7.

## Core Value

**Visitors can learn who Xzandria is, what she stands for, and easily donate to support her campaign.**

Everything else supports this flow.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Single-page landing site with smooth scrolling sections
- [ ] Donation section with external platform link (placeholder for now)
- [ ] Candidate bio/statement section (who she is, why she's running, vision)
- [ ] Photo gallery section (campaign members, community, supporters)
- [ ] Platform/issues section (key positions for Houston County)
- [ ] Visual design using campaign colors from provided palette
- [ ] Modern, elegant aesthetic with clean typography
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Hosted on Digital Ocean

### Out of Scope

- Multi-page architecture — keeping it single-page for simplicity and timeline
- Built-in payment processing — will link to external platform (WinRed/ActBlue/etc.)
- Complex features like events calendar, news blog, volunteer forms — defer if needed
- Content management system — static content updated via code

## Context

**Timeline:** Hard deadline of March 7 (~2 weeks from Feb 23)

**Target audience:** Houston County, GA voters — need a site that builds trust, communicates vision clearly, and makes donating easy

**Brand assets:**
- Campaign logo with stylized "X" and "ARMSTRONG" text (user likes the font)
- Color palette provided (teals/golds from reference image)
- Photos coming: candidate portraits, campaign members, community events, supporters

**Hosting:** Digital Ocean (likely static deployment via App Platform or Droplet)

**Technical direction:** Nuxt.js/Vue single-page application — user specified this preference

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: Launch by March 7 — extremely tight, dictates scope choices
- **Tech stack**: Nuxt.js (Vue) — user preference
- **Hosting**: Digital Ocean — deployment target
- **Content**: Limited now, more photos/text coming — design needs to accommodate evolving content
- **Budget**: Not explicitly stated, but Digital Ocean hosting suggests cost-conscious approach

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Single-page vs multi-page | Tight timeline + simpler to build + content still arriving | — Pending |
| External donation platform | No payment processing setup yet, faster to integrate | — Pending |
| Nuxt.js framework | User preference, good for static site deployment | — Pending |
