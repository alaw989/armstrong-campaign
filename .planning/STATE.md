## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**Nuxt 4 with og-image disabled (01-01):** Disabled @nuxt/og-image module due to unenv dependency incompatibility. Sitemap and robots.txt work correctly without it.

**TypeScript typeCheck disabled for dev (01-01):** Set typeCheck: false to avoid vite-plugin-checker conflicts. Strict mode remains for compile-time checks.

**Neutral colors for navigation (01-02):** Used neutral grays for navigation styling to defer brand color application until Phase 2 when design system is established.

**80px scroll offset (01-02):** Set scroll-padding-top and scroll-margin-top to 80px to account for sticky navigation height.
