# Design Reference
Follow https://diijondacosta.com/ patterns:
- Members: Round headshots, name, role, grid layout
- Endorsements: Blockquote-style cards with quote, name, title
- Contact/Get Involved: Three-column layout (Volunteer | Donate | Stay Informed)
- Social links: Icon buttons in footer and contact section

# Phase 1 Patterns
- Use Composition API with <script setup lang="ts">
- Semantic HTML (section, article, blockquote, cite, footer)
- Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Section IDs for Navigation scroll spy
- Use app.config.ts for configurable content
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create MembersSection component</name>
  <files>components/MembersSection.vue</files>
  <action>
Create components/MembersSection.vue:

1. Section structure:
   - section id="team" with py-20 bg-gray-50
   - Container mx-auto px-4
   - Section heading: h2 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-12

2. Member data (interface and array):
   ```typescript
   interface TeamMember {
     id: string
     name: string
     role: string
     photo: string
     alt?: string
   }

   const members: TeamMember[] = [
     {
       id: '1',
       name: 'Jane Smith',
       role: 'Campaign Manager',
       photo: '/images/team/jane-smith.jpg',
       alt: 'Jane Smith, Campaign Manager'
     },
     // ... 4-8 members
   ]
   ```

3. Grid layout:
   - div with grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6
   - Each member in a card

4. Member card structure:
   - div with bg-white rounded-lg p-6 text-center shadow-md
   - Photo: img or NuxtImg, w-32 h-32, rounded-full, mx-auto, mb-4, object-cover
   - Name: h3 font-semibold text-lg text-gray-900
   - Role: p text-gray-600

5. Empty state:
   - If no members, show "Team coming soon!" message

6. Accessibility:
   - Images have alt text (name + role)
   - Cards are non-interactive (just display)

7. Note: Use placeholder images until campaign provides photos
  </action>
  <verify>
    Component exists at components/MembersSection.vue with id="team", h2 heading, members array, grid layout, and member card template with photo/name/role.
  </verify>
  <done>
    MembersSection displays team members in responsive grid (1/2/4 columns). Each member has photo, name, and role. Handles empty state gracefully.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create EndorsementsSection component</name>
  <files>components/EndorsementsSection.vue</files>
  <action>
Create components/EndorsementsSection.vue:

1. Section structure:
   - section id="endorsements" with py-20 (white background)
   - Container mx-auto px-4
   - max-w-4xl mx-auto for content (not full width)
   - Section heading: h2 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-12

2. Endorsement data:
   ```typescript
   interface Endorsement {
     id: string
     quote: string
     name: string
     title: string
     organization?: string
   }

   const endorsements: Endorsement[] = [
     {
       id: '1',
       quote: "Xzandria Armstrong brings the leadership and integrity Houston County needs. Her commitment to our schools and families is unwavering.",
       name: 'Dr. Sarah Johnson',
       title: 'Former Houston County School Board Member'
     },
     // ... 3-5 endorsements
   ]
   ```

3. Endorsement card structure:
   - blockquote element (semantic)
   - bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-md border-l-4 border-teal-800
   - Quote: p text-lg italic mb-4 text-gray-700
   - Quote marks: Opening &ldquo; and closing &rdquo;
   - Footer: cite element (not-italic)
   - Name: strong text-gray-900
   - Title/organization: span text-gray-600 block text-sm

4. Layout:
   - div with space-y-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto
   - Each endorsement in its own blockquote

5. Empty state:
   - If no endorsements, show "Endorsements coming soon!" message

6. Accessibility:
   - blockquote is semantic for quotations
   - cite element identifies source
   - Proper heading hierarchy

7. Note: Placeholder content until campaign provides actual endorsements
  </action>
  <verify>
    Component exists at components/EndorsementsSection.vue with id="endorsements", h2 heading, endorsements array, blockquote elements with quote/cite structure.
  </verify>
  <done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update app.config.ts with team and endorsements content</name>
  <files>app.config.ts</files>
  <action>
Update app.config.ts to add team and endorsements configuration:

1. Add team members configuration:
   ```typescript
   team: [
     {
       id: '1',
       name: 'Jane Smith',
       role: 'Campaign Manager',
       photo: '/images/team/jane-smith.jpg'
     },
     {
       id: '2',
       name: 'John Doe',
       role: 'Treasurer',
       photo: '/images/team/john-doe.jpg'
     }
   ]
   ```

2. Add endorsements configuration:
   ```typescript
   endorsements: [
     {
       id: '1',
       quote: "Xzandria Armstrong brings the leadership and integrity Houston County needs. Her commitment to our schools and families is unwavering.",
       name: 'Dr. Sarah Johnson',
       title: 'Former Houston County School Board Member'
     },
     {
       id: '2',
       quote: "I've seen Xzandria's dedication to our community firsthand. She listens, she cares, and she gets things done.",
       name: 'Rev. Michael Williams',
       title: 'Pastor, First Baptist Church of Warner Robins'
     }
   ]
   ```

Note: All values are placeholders to be replaced with campaign-provided information.
  </action>
  <verify>
    app.config.ts contains team array (with id, name, role, photo) and endorsements array (with id, quote, name, title).
  </verify>
  <done>
    app.config.ts includes configurable team and endorsements content. Content can be easily updated when campaign provides final details.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Update Navigation.vue sections array</name>
  <files>components/Navigation.vue</files>
  <action>
Update components/Navigation.vue sections array to include team and endorsements:

1. Add two new entries to the sections array (after 'gallery', before 'contact'):
   - { id: 'team', name: 'Team' }
   - { id: 'endorsements', name: 'Endorsements' }

2. Final sections array should be:
   ```typescript
   const sections = [
     { id: 'hero', name: 'Home' },
     { id: 'about', name: 'About' },
     { id: 'platform', name: 'Platform' },
     { id: 'gallery', name: 'Gallery' },
     { id: 'team', name: 'Team' },
     { id: 'endorsements', name: 'Endorsements' },
     { id: 'contact', name: 'Contact' }
   ]
   ```

  </action>
  <verify>
    Navigation.vue sections array includes 7 entries with 'team' and 'endorsements' added in correct positions.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Navigation includes links to Team and Endorsements sections. Scroll spy will highlight these sections when visible.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 5: Create placeholder team directory and integrate sections</name>
  <files>public/images/team/.gitkeep, public/images/team/README.md, pages/index.vue</files>
  <action>
1. Create team image directory: public/images/team/
   - Add .gitkeep file (empty)
   - Add README.md:
   ```markdown
   # Campaign Team Photos

   Place team member headshots in this directory.

   ## Requirements
   - Square or 4:5 aspect ratio (400x400 or 400x500px)
   - Professional headshot style
   - JPG or PNG format
   - Naming: {name}.jpg (e.g., jane-smith.jpg)

   ## Alt Text
   Update components/MembersSection.vue with proper alt text: "{Name}, {Role}"
   ```

2. Update pages/index.vue to include team and endorsements sections (add after gallery, before contact placeholder):
   ```vue
   <!-- Team Members -->
   <section id="team">
     <MembersSection />
   </section>

   <!-- Endorsements -->
   <section id="endorsements">
     <EndorsementsSection />
   </section>
   ```

3. Note: ContactSection will be added in plan 02-06

4. Verify smooth scroll to all sections works
  </action>
  <verify>
    public/images/team/ exists with .gitkeep and README.md. pages/index.vue contains team and endorsements sections with proper IDs.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Homepage displays Team and Endorsements sections. Navigation links scroll to these sections. Scroll spy highlights correctly.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Overall verification steps:

1. Build verification: Run `npm run generate` — site builds without errors
2. Visual verification: Open .output/public/index.html in browser
3. Members section visible with grid layout (or "coming soon")
4. Endorsements section visible with blockquote-style cards (or "coming soon")
5. Navigation has "Team" and "Endorsements" links
6. Clicking "Team" scrolls to team section
7. Clicking "Endorsements" scrolls to endorsements section
8. Scroll spy highlights "Team" when scrolled into view
9. Scroll spy highlights "Endorsements" when scrolled into view

Note: Team photos and endorsement quotes are placeholders. Components should handle missing data gracefully.
