<objective>
Create the About and Platform sections — the core content areas where voters learn about the candidate and her positions.

Purpose: The About section builds personal connection and trust. The Platform section communicates specific policy positions in a scannable, card-based format. Together they answer "Who is she?" and "What does she stand for?"

Output: AboutSection.vue with bio content, PlatformSection.vue with card grid, PlatformCard.vue reusable component, integrated into index.vue.

# Design Reference
Follow https://diijondacosta.com/ patterns:
- About: Clean typography with section headers (Who I Am, Why I'm Running, Vision)
- Platform/Leadership: Numbered cards (01, 02, 03...) with hover effects
- Card grid: Responsive (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
- Section backgrounds alternating between white and light gray/teal

# Phase 1 Patterns
- Use Composition API with <script setup lang="ts">
- Semantic HTML (section, article, h2, h3)
- Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Section IDs for Navigation scroll spy
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create PlatformCard component with hover effects</name>
  <files>components/PlatformCard.vue</files>
  <action>
Create components/PlatformCard.vue as a reusable card component:

1. Props interface:
   - title: string (required)
   - description: string (required)
   - icon: string (emoji or icon name, optional)
   - number: string (for "01", "02", etc., optional)

2. Card structure:
   - article element (semantic)
   - Background: white with shadow-md
   - Hover: shadow-lg, subtle lift effect (transition-all)
   - Rounded corners (rounded-lg)
   - Padding: p-6
   - Border-l-4 border-teal-800 (accent on left)

3. Content layout:
   - Optional number display (top right, large, gray-200)
   - Icon circle (if provided): w-12 h-12, rounded-full, bg-teal-50, teal-800 text
   - Title: h3, text-xl font-semibold, text-gray-900
   - Description: p, text-gray-700, leading-relaxed

4. Accessibility:
   - article role
   - Keyboard accessible (add tabindex="0" if interactive)
   - Focus visible styles

5. Hover effect:
   - -translate-y-1 on hover (subtle lift)
   - Smooth transition (transition-all duration-200)

Note: Use emoji for icons initially (simple, no library needed). Phase 2 plan 03 can add proper icon library if needed.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Component exists at components/PlatformCard.vue with props interface, article element, h3 title, p description, and hover effect classes.
  </verify>
  <done>
    PlatformCard renders title, description, optional icon, and optional number. Has hover lift effect and WCAG-compliant contrast.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create PlatformSection component with card grid</name>
  <files>components/PlatformSection.vue</files>
  <action>
Create components/PlatformSection.vue:

1. Section structure:
   - section id="platform" with py-20 bg-gray-50
   - Container mx-auto px-4
   - Section heading: h2 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-4
   - Subheading: p text-center text-lg text-gray-600 mb-12 max-w-2xl mx-auto

2. Platform positions data (define in component, move to config later):
   ```typescript
   interface PlatformPosition {
     id: string
     title: string
     description: string
     icon: string
   }

   const positions: PlatformPosition[] = [
     {
       id: 'education',
       title: 'Education',
       description: 'Investing in our schools and ensuring every child has access to quality education.',
       icon: '📚'
     },
     {
       id: 'economy',
       title: 'Economic Growth',
       description: 'Supporting local businesses and creating good-paying jobs for Houston County families.',
       icon: '💼'
     },
     {
       id: 'public-safety',
       title: 'Public Safety',
       description: 'Ensuring our neighborhoods are safe and supporting our first responders.',
       icon: '🛡️'
     },
     {
       id: 'infrastructure',
       title: 'Infrastructure',
       description: 'Improving roads, bridges, and broadband access for all communities.',
       icon: '🏗️'
     },
     {
       id: 'healthcare',
       title: 'Healthcare Access',
       description: 'Expanding access to quality healthcare and reducing costs for families.',
       icon: '🏥'
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Card grid:
   - div with grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6
   - v-for rendering PlatformCard for each position
   - Pass title, description, icon to PlatformCard
   - :key="position.id"

4. Accessibility:
   - aria-label="Platform positions"
   - Cards are in semantic article elements (from PlatformCard)

5. Styling:
   - Alternating background (bg-gray-50) to differentiate from adjacent white sections
   - Proper spacing between cards
  </action>
  <verify>
    Component exists at components/PlatformSection.vue with id="platform", h2 heading, positions array with 5 items, grid layout with PlatformCard components in v-for loop.
  </verify>
  <done>
    PlatformSection displays 5 platform position cards in responsive grid. Content is editable via positions array. Scroll spy highlights "Platform" when scrolled into view.

  </action>
  <verify>
    Component exists at components/AboutSection.vue with id="about", h2 heading, three subsections (Who I Am, Why I'm Running, My Vision) with h3 headings, and placeholder paragraph content.
  </verify>
  <done>
    AboutSection displays three content sections explaining Xzandria's background, motivation, and vision. Text is readable with proper typography hierarchy. Content is configurable via app.config.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Update app.config.ts with about and platform content</name>
  <files>app.config.ts</files>
  <action>
Update app.config.ts to add about and platform content:

1. Add about section:
   ```typescript
   about: {
     title: 'About Xzandria',
     who: `Xzandria Armstrong is a lifelong Houston County resident with deep roots in our community. A product of our public schools and a graduate of Houston County High School, she understands the challenges and opportunities facing our families.

   After earning her degree from Georgia Southern University, Xzandria returned to Houston County to build her life and career here. She has worked in education and local business, giving her firsthand experience with the issues that matter most to our community.`,
     why: `I'm running for Houston County because I believe in our community's potential. I've seen families struggling to make ends meet, teachers working hard with limited resources, and small businesses trying to recover from difficult times.

   We need leadership that listens to residents and puts people before politics. I'm running to ensure every voice in Houston County is heard and every family has the opportunity to thrive.`,
     vision: `Together, we can build a Houston County where every child receives a quality education, every neighborhood is safe, and every family has access to good jobs and healthcare. A community that honors its past while building a brighter future for the next generation.

   My vision is of a Houston County that works for everyone — where opportunity is abundant, leaders are accountable, and progress lifts up all our residents.`
   }
   ```

2. Add platform positions (can be used to replace hardcoded positions in PlatformSection):
   ```typescript
   platform: {
     title: 'My Platform',
     subtitle: "Here's where I stand on the issues that matter most to Houston County.",
     positions: [
       {
         id: 'education',
         title: 'Education',
         description: 'Investing in our schools and ensuring every child has access to quality education.',
         icon: '📚'
       },
       // ... other positions
     ]
   }
   ```

Note: The placeholder content above will be replaced with campaign-provided content before launch.
  </action>
  <verify>
    app.config.ts contains about object with who/why/vision strings, and platform object with title/subtitle/positions array.
  </verify>
  <done>
    app.config.ts includes configurable content for About section (who, why, vision) and Platform positions. Content can be easily updated when campaign provides final text.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 5: Integrate AboutSection and PlatformSection into index.vue</name>
  <files>pages/index.vue</files>
  <action>
Update pages/index.vue to include AboutSection and PlatformSection:

1. Add sections after HeroSection, in order:
   - HeroSection (id="hero", existing)
   - AboutSection (id="about", new)
   - PlatformSection (id="platform", new)

2. Each section wrapped in its own section element with appropriate id for Navigation:
   ```vue
   <template>
     <!-- Hero -->
     <section id="hero">
       <HeroSection />
     </section>

     <!-- About -->
     <section id="about">
       <AboutSection />
     </section>

     <!-- Platform -->
     <section id="platform">
       <PlatformSection />
     </section>
   </template>
   ```

3. Import components:
   ```typescript
   <script setup lang="ts">
   // No explicit imports needed in Nuxt 3 — components are auto-imported
   useHead({
     title: 'Home - Xzandria Armstrong for Houston County',
     meta: [
       { name: 'description', content: 'Leadership for Houston County, GA. Support Xzandria Armstrong\'s campaign for progress, integrity, and community.' }
     ]
   })
   </script>
   ```

4. Verify smooth scroll between sections works with Navigation component
  </action>
  <verify>
    pages/index.vue contains three section elements (hero, about, platform) with corresponding components, proper IDs, and sections appear in correct order.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Homepage displays Hero, About, and Platform sections. Navigation links scroll smoothly to each section. Scroll spy highlights active section as user scrolls.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>
