<objective>
Fix visual issues identified during UAT: doubled candidate photo in hero section and missing pointer cursor on navigation links.

Purpose: Close gaps between expected and actual user experience before proceeding to Phase 3.
Output: Clean hero image display and proper hover affordance on navigation.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix doubled candidate photo in hero section</name>
  <files>components/HeroSection.vue</files>
  <action>
    The issue is that `showPlaceholder` is initialized to `true`, causing both the placeholder div AND the actual image to render simultaneously until the image loads. The image exists at `/images/candidate-portrait.svg`, so it loads but both elements show stacked.

    Fix: Initialize `showPlaceholder.value = false` (line 28) so the placeholder only shows on error, not by default.

    Reference existing code:
    - Line 28: `const showPlaceholder = ref(true)` — CHANGE to `ref(false)`
    - Lines 99-129: Image and placeholder structure remains unchanged
    - Placeholder should only appear when `imageError` is true (actual image failure)

    This ensures:
    1. On initial render, only the `<img>` tag attempts to load
    2. If image loads successfully → only image shows
    3. If image fails to load → `handleImageError` sets `imageError = true` and placeholder appears

    Desktop navigation links (lines 111-127) are `<button>` elements with hover color transitions but no explicit pointer cursor. Add `cursor-pointer` class to provide hover affordance.

    Change line 115:
    FROM: `class="text-sm font-medium transition-colors relative py-2"`
    TO: `class="text-sm font-medium transition-colors relative py-2 cursor-pointer"`

    Also add `cursor-pointer` to mobile navigation buttons (line 183):
    FROM: `class="block w-full text-left px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-base font-medium transition-colors"`
    TO: `class="block w-full text-left px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-base font-medium transition-colors cursor-pointer"`

    This provides proper UI affordance indicating these elements are clickable/interactive.

<success_criteria>
1. Hero candidate photo displays as single image with no stacking/doubling artifact
2. All navigation links (desktop and mobile) show pointer cursor on hover
3. No regressions to existing functionality (image still loads on error, navigation still scrolls)
</success_criteria>
