<objective>
Add FEC and Georgia GTCFC compliant legal disclaimers to the footer component.

Purpose: Political campaign websites are legally required to display specific disclaimers on every page. Failure to comply can result in fines and legal action. This must be in place before any content is added.

Output: Footer component with legally compliant disclaimers that appear on every page of the site.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add legal disclaimers to AppFooter component</name>
  <files>
    components/AppFooter.vue
  </files>
  <action>
    Update components/AppFooter.vue with FEC-compliant legal disclaimers:

    1. **Required disclaimer text** (11 CFR 110.11 for authorized candidate committee):
    - Primary line: "Paid for by Armstrong for Houston County Committee"
    - Secondary notice: "Contributions or gifts to Armstrong for Houston County Committee are not tax deductible."

    2. **Structure:**
    ```vue
    <template>
      <footer class="bg-gray-900 text-white py-8">
        <div class="container mx-auto px-4">
          <!-- Legal disclaimers - REQUIRED ON EVERY PAGE -->
          <div class="text-sm mb-6 border-t border-gray-700 pt-6">
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-300">
              Paid for by Armstrong for Houston County Committee
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-xs">
              Contributions or gifts to Armstrong for Houston County Committee are not tax deductible.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Placeholder for contact info (added in Phase 2) -->
          <div class="text-xs text-gray-500">
            <p>&copy; 2026 Armstrong for Houston County Committee. All rights reserved.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </footer>
    </template>
    ```

    3. **Styling requirements for compliance:**
    - Text must be "clear and conspicuous"
    - Text size: At least as large as majority of other text on page (text-sm meets this)
    - Contrast: Use light text on dark background (text-gray-300/400 on bg-gray-900 exceeds 4.5:1)
    - Location: In footer (visible on every page via default layout)

    4. **Add a script section** to make committee name configurable via nuxt.config.ts:
    ```vue
    <script setup lang="ts">
    const config = useAppConfig()
    // Committee name can be overridden in app.config.ts if needed
    const committeeName = 'Armstrong for Houston County Committee'
    </script>
    ```

    NOTE: The exact committee name should be confirmed with the campaign treasurer.
    "Armstrong for Houston County Committee" is a placeholder based on research.

    For Georgia-specific compliance: The FEC disclaimer is sufficient for federal requirements.
    Georgia GTCFC requires committee registration (triggered at $500+ raised/spent) but does not
    specify additional disclaimer language for websites beyond FEC requirements.

    1. Check AppFooter.vue contains "Paid for by" text
    2. Check AppFooter.vue contains "not tax deductible" text
    3. Check text color (text-gray-300) and background (bg-gray-900) have sufficient contrast
    4. Run `npm run dev` and view footer - disclaimers should be visible
  </verify>
  <done>
    AppFooter component updated with:
    - FEC-compliant "Paid for by" disclaimer
    - "Not tax deductible" notice
    - Sufficient color contrast (light text on dark background)
    - Committee name defined as configurable constant
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add committee name configuration to app.config.ts</name>
  <files>
    app.config.ts
  </files>
  <action>
    Update app.config.ts to include committee name for easy configuration:

    ```ts
    export default defineAppConfig({
      site: {
        name: 'Xzandria Armstrong for Houston County',
        description: 'Leadership for Houston County, GA'
      },
      committee: {
        name: 'Armstrong for Houston County Committee',
        // Update these when treasurer provides official details
        address: '',
        phone: '',
        email: ''
      }
    })
    ```

    Then update AppFooter.vue to use this config:
    ```ts
    const config = useAppConfig()
    const committeeName = config.committee.name
    ```

    This allows the committee name to be changed in one place if the official name differs from the placeholder.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Check app.config.ts exists with committee.name
    2. Check AppFooter.vue uses useAppConfig() to read committee name
    3. Run `npm run dev` - footer displays committee name from config
  </verify>
  <done>
    Committee name configured in app.config.ts:
    - Committee name defined centrally
    - AppFooter reads from useAppConfig()
    - Placeholder name ready to be updated with official name
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Run `npm run dev` and view the page
2. Scroll to footer - verify "Paid for by" disclaimer is visible
3. Check contrast - verify text is readable against background
4. Verify disclaimer appears on default layout (will appear on all pages)
5. Try changing committee name in app.config.ts - verify it updates in footer
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Footer displays FEC-compliant "Paid for by" disclaimer
- Footer includes "not tax deductible" notice
- Disclaimer text has sufficient color contrast (>4.5:1)
- Committee name is configurable via app.config.ts
- Disclaimer appears on every page via default layout
</success_criteria>
